# ShadyM-MGame
 
Hackathon Challenge

In our 24h project, we developed a game with our 4-elements team.
Inspired in the Song Lose Yourself, it was decided to create a game where we chose our rap name and then have a 2-round Rap Battle within a time frame. All players battle each other. Winners advance to the nex round playing other winners. Winner is picked the the audience and a final scoreboard is displayed after the final round!
